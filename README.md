# LeoConsole-repo-contrib

This is the contrib repository for [LeoConsole](https://github.com/BoettcherDasOriginal/LeoConsole)'s
[apkg](https://github.com/alexcoder04/LeoConsole-apkg).

It is the unofficial repository. It is moderated by LeoConsole (co-)developers
and trusted users, however everyone can submit their own packages.

You can imagine it as a kind of AUR if you are familiar with Arch Linux.

You can enable it by adding following line to your `var/apkg/repos`:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexcoder04/LeoConsole-repo-contrib/main/index.json
```

Contributions are welcome! If you know how repo indexes work, just open a PR
adding your package. If unsure, just open an issue.
